Hi, I'm Fatih. 
I usually code in c# but also code in little bit of everything that intrigues me. I'm that kind of patchwork dev. :)
Currently working on a fantasy pc game using unity as my main project and doing some side projects to learn stuff and keep myself busy. Some examples are;
- Photogrammetry automation device using arduino and stepper motors.
- HID device with joystick and 9 multi function keys for game development and video editing as main usage.

I also like to tinker with no-brand devices software or optimize old hardware to repurpose them.
